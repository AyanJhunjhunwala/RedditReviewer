      "  ve been a big fan of John Mayer for a long time and I've learnt most of his stuff. This includes Neon which took me a few weeks of dedicated practice and made me appreciate how he plays it AND sings at the same time. I couldn't hope to sing that song while playing. I was talking with some lads in this music club I'm involved in and they all seemed to hate John Mayer for his apparent arrogance and 'generic' musical ability.\n",
      "  \n",
      "I don't understand this hate for John. Technique-wise, he's up there with Hendrix and SRV. He's one of the few people who I believe could play anything on the guitar, acoustic or electric. He's so technically advanced but yet, puts out a piece like slow dancing in a burning room which is so melodical and deliberate. I honestly think he's one of the most brilliant guitarists in history and might even go down as the GOAT. He also seems very down to earth in the interviews that I've seen.\n",
      "John Mayer is a great guitarist who makes music I don‚Äôt like.\n",
      "Personally I love Mayer as a musician and think he gives awesome interviews as long as they were taped in the last 4 years. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hate boils down to:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. A misconception that he does soft rock for girls. This is based on songs like Your Body is a Wonderland or Daughters. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. He used to be extremely arrogant and a narcissist. He claims to have changed his ways as he‚Äôs aged and I personally buy it cause lord knows I have. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Personal preferences. People like different things. Van Halen is a great guitarist but I don‚Äôt know a single song he‚Äôs done that I like.\n",
      "He's a better guitar player than me and he's better looking than me so FUCK HIM!!!\n",
      "His music gets pussy. Dudes hate other dudes getting pussy.\n",
      "Personality wise he seems like a massive tool, but to me his music is just super bland. To each their own, of course, but I‚Äôd only ever listen to him against my will.\n",
      "pocket airport dull selective dazzling pen capable dependent apparatus tart\n",
      "\n",
      " *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev/home)*\n",
      "He plays guitar better than me, is a millionaire, fucks hot girls daily. I‚Äôm jealous.\n",
      "Great guitarist - still a little too much of a throwback to the blues rock pioneers to be a GOAT, but that's just personal taste. The problem for me is that his songwriting style and general vibe is cringey and normcore. No edge to it, not even the faintest whiff of the countercultural tendencies that have always defined blues and rock to some degree. On the same level as Maroon 5 the Dave Matthews Band, Jack Johnson. He exudes privilege and the sense of never having had much of a struggle in life. I don't hate him for that but I like my blues to weep. And I like my rich berklee kids to embrace the avant garde and live a decade of self imposed artistic poverty  before making it. He just always came across as a kind of impressive but empty vessel, carrying a cargo of lots of very typical love songs but not much more.\n",
      "It‚Äôs amazing to me how few people here know what he‚Äôs been up to the last 8 years.  What he‚Äôs done with Dead &amp; Co is legendary.  If you‚Äôre not into the Dead you don‚Äôt get, and I get that.  But his playing has been as good as it gets.  There‚Äôs not another guitarist in the world (not even Trey) who could command the respect of a fan base like Deadheads in the role of a ‚Äúdeity‚Äù like Garcia..  And I‚Äôm stoked to see what his next project will be.\n",
      "\n",
      "P.S.  His instagram ‚Äúlessons‚Äù are very entertaining and quality content for this type of sub.  Dude loves to play and practice.  \n",
      "\n",
      "And his songwriting process is revolutionary:  https://youtu.be/qfc5efQBDpY?si=fqPrpZwlhdN2ujZO\n",
      "His guitar playing is great, and he seems like a cool guy. I enjoyed his interview on Rick Rubin‚Äôs podcast. But man, when I put on one of his albums, it‚Äôs just snoozeville. I need to try some of his side projects maybe? But I never feel very motivated to\n",
      "\n",
      "(To be clear, it‚Äôs not that I need him to be shredding or playing super technically. I just feel like he‚Äôs yawning his way through every song and that‚Äôs the overall vibe)\n",
      "It‚Äôs hard to make money with music. Most guitarists disliked how much money he made with his earlier stuff. Like neon is pretty technically cool. But most people just hear pop and don‚Äôt analyze it further. Once he made his fans and money he started doing passion projects. Which just furthered people‚Äôs envious feelings. You know how hard it is to play whatever the fuck you want to sold out stadiums? \n",
      "\n",
      "All the greats respect him. His gigs have been crazy as of late. \n",
      "\n",
      "To not place Mayer as a great is just being envious; because the greats consider him as a peer. You can be a fan, or not; but still as a musician you should objectively see how great of a musician Mayer is.\n",
      "I didn't realize until like last year that he's a legit guitarist. people that say he's not are smoking crack through their dick. I think he's great.\n",
      "Great technical guitarist producing mind numbingly bland music\n",
      "I think he's talented but his music does absolutely nothing for me.\n",
      " Not a lot of guys can step into Jerry Garcia‚Äôs shoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jus sayin‚Ä¶\n",
      "People say he‚Äôs a little rascist or something but honestly coming from a black guy here he‚Äôs definitely one of my top three guitarist. Eric Clapton is a POS tho üòÇ\n",
      "He's got looks.  He's got licks.  Of course he gets hate üòú   It's like dude leave something for us mortals, would you?\n",
      "I grew up in Connecticut at roughly the same time as John Mayer, though he‚Äôs a few years older and from a different town. I knew people who knew him in high school and after he was famous. Those who knew him in high school described him a major band geek. Those who knew him after he was famous described what was undoubtedly the behaviour of a lothario. Having also experienced both geekdom/lack of female attention in high school and then a very minor ‚Äúglow up‚Äù, I can understand both Mayer‚Äôs behaviour and why people dislike him. \n",
      "\n",
      "In short, I think people dislike him due to his celebrity behaviour, especially as a young man (he seems to have matured) and it is almost entirely unrelated to his prodigious musical ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edited for grammar\n",
      "All I can say is John Mayer Trio. Knowing his pop stuff and then getting that in like 2005/2006 blew my mind. It was fantastic.\n",
      "\n",
      "His personal life, well, that shit is different.\n",
      "I wasn't really a fan of his because I thought he was all about being a rock star and dating models. However, he is a dedicated guitarist and has given back quite a bit. He developed a great guitar with PRS and he posts many very helpful guitar demonstrations for players. When you're young and given the sort of fame he was, you're bound to make a few goofs along the way. I say he has earned some respect!\n",
      "I just don‚Äôt ‚Äòget‚Äô it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I don‚Äôt hate the guy ‚Äî and I‚Äôll readily admit he‚Äôs a great guitar player ‚Äî but his music does absolutely nothing for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, I‚Äôm the same way with most ‚Äòguitar‚Äô guys ‚Äî Mayer, Bonnamassa, Satriani, Vai, Gilbert, etc. Just massive nothingburgers for me, musically. Great players who happen to write music I don‚Äôt wanna listen to.\n",
      "One of the greatest guitar players of all time , hands down. If you don‚Äôt think so than you‚Äôve prob only heard his pop songs on the radio\n",
      "He's a better player than most everyone, attractive, can sing, could probably seduce you and your girl\n",
      "He's a great guitarist that writes lame music. There are plenty of bad guitarists that write amazing music. One of my favorite guitarists is Daron Malakian, and he SUCKS! What he lacks in talent, he makes up for with creativity, songwriting, and energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't care how many jazz phrasings Mayer slips into his songs, his music is just uninteresting. Shit puts me to sleep.\n",
      "I think many people that dislike him prob just equate him to body is a wonderland type music or get caught up in his media presence. If they ever really have his live music a listen it may change their mind as he is an absolutely incredible player that has completely grown to expand his creative abilities since joining Dead and Co. \n",
      "\n",
      "I mean this guy went from being pretty much traditional blues and acoustic (which he was already great at) to owning full stadiums of dead heads following his every note through psychedelic long form jams while gaining their respect which is incredible hard in the Dead community, especially if you have the baggage of being John Mayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Years ago what really showcased talent to me was a clip of him on the Clapton crossroads festival. He absolutely shredded and I had no idea he could play so well.\n",

      "John Mayer Net Worth - 70 mil  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Look - as a guitar player you can not like his songs.  I would argue they aren't for you, and never were.  There are a couple that Mayer put some \"this'll fuckem\" foo into - cough neon cough. For the most part HE KNOWS he's writing for the masses and apparently he's 7x correct on that point....   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "He wanted Fuck You money - he got Fuck You money. Now he does whatever he wants - including playing with the Dead, and kissing all the Jennifer's, or writing a different genre of album each time.    \n",

      "I think the hate is more to do with his personality than his guitar skills\n",

      "A lot of these takes in these threads that ‚ÄúJohn Mayer isn‚Äôt musical‚Äù or that he doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äútechnical abilities‚Äù are completely fucking delusional.\n",
      "Working retail in the early 2000s solidified my hate there, not even gonna lie. The same bullshit adult contemporary playlist over and over and over and over. He had at least 3 tracks on there. I will never forgive.\n",
      "Never was a fan of his and when he was announced to play with Dead and Co, this lifelong Dead Head who saw Jerry about 120 times was not happy. But Bob Weir knows his shit so I gave him a chance. About 18 shows later , while he's no Jerry, he understands what Grateful Dead is about and put his front man attitude aside and tore it up. Just listen to any Brown Eyed Women when he and Jeff Chimenti made magic. The last three shows in San Francisco were amazing. Will I go see him solo? If he comes to New Orleans maybe. If he hooks up with Jeff and Otiel again most definitely.\n",
      "He‚Äôs an amazing player but his music is super boring. I  also can‚Äôt stand all the uninspired guitarists online copying John Mayer down to his fucking clothing. This goes for SRV and Jimi wannabes too. We don‚Äôt need another SRV,Jimi, or Mayer because we already have them.  He created an epidemic of boring internet guitarists.\n",
      "He's a great player. He just comes off as kind of a douche.\n",
      "The \"hate\" he gets isn't usually directed at his musicianship; it's his personality, which is a bit of a love-it-or-hate-it proposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frankly, I don't care about an artist's personal life and judge purely based on the art they produce.  And Mayer is a terrific musician, no question.  That said:\n",

      "\n",
      "This is an absurd comment.  Mayer is a fine guitarist, no question.  But if you think he could play how/what Guthrie Govan plays, or Allan Holdsworth, or Shawn Lane, or Joe Pass, or Tommy Emmanuel, or Christopher Parkening, or Danny Gatton (etc) you're living in a fantasy world.  There are hundreds of Instagram guitarists who dwarf him technique-wise.  Like I said, terrific, tasteful and soulful guitarist, but if you think he's the GOAT you need to get out more, so to speak.\n",

      "He‚Äôs also done a lot for Hendrix and SRV estates. Tons of people are aware of and are enthusiastic about Hendrix and Stevie because of Mayer. He‚Äôs helped keep the blues alive. No doubt about it. I see tons of impressive Younger players (I‚Äôm 49) that are emulating these older musicians now because of the Mayer thread.\n",

Yes, he is incredibly proficient, and yes, he does have his on voice in it, BUT if you think he can play anything (literlly), or that he has a shot of being crowned as THE GOAT, sorry man, but that's your preference speaking. The sh\\*t some other players alive right now are playing are basically in a league of it's own, Govan and Abasi being easy namedrops, and I'm sure there might be some I dont even know. I don't think the GOAT title makes any sense, as since there's no real way to quantify it, all we can do is to put the contestants together. That said, as much as I like Mayer, unless he has a whole hidden discography under a pseudonym or smt, I'm not sure he'd be even in the GOAT candidates for blues alone. There's nothing wrong with that, it doesn't mean he can't be anyones favorite. Everyone resonates more with different stuff, right? It's just that there are borderline gods out there, and if you had the chance to talk with Mayer about it, he might have some interesting two centz.\n",

I got off that website for that very reason too many fan boys. They have a strange love for PRS guitars, analogman pedals and rat distortion pedals. Strange group of guys altogether\n",
      "Never hated him, just have zero interest. Seems like a boring person who can play guitar and his music doesnt click with me.\n",
      "He just...disappoints me. He's so super talented, but his music doesn't excite me at all and it feels like a waste, lol.\n",
      "I don't like his vocals. I don't like his songwriting and song compositions, but that may be because of the vocals. His guitar playing is fine. He is technically accomplished but his playing doesn't move me. I acknowledge this is subjective.\n",
      "Personally, I don‚Äôt like his voice.\n",
      "The hate comes from:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  The dude's first singles were adult contemporary pop.  You had to listen below the surface of some of it to realize there was genius in it, even the cheeseball \"Your Body is a Wonderland\" is pretty dope.\n",
      "2. His goofy ass awkward nature didn't help his image.  \n",
      "3. People often don't view him as an authentic bluesman because he comes from white suburban Connecticut and went to music school for awhile.\n",
      "4. People who are too obsessed with Taylor Swift and want to hate on him for their failed relationship.  I'm a Swiftie myself, but these people are delusional.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hate is misplaced as hell.  The dude has amazing technical ability and knows how to create killer chord progressions and hooks.  His songwriting is usually solid, and he often writes insanely good lyrics.  He used to be kind of a goofball bordering on being a douchebag as far as I can tell but since he joined Dead &amp; Company, it seems to have matured him immensely.  I think he needed to join a project where he is not always the star and where he has to serve something much bigger than himself.\n",
      "What doesn't work for me about him is his voice / singing style. I found it kinda boring.\n",
      "&gt; Technique-wise, he's up there with Hendrix and SRV\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt; might even go down as the GOAT\n",
      "\n",
      "I know music is subjective but are you high?\n",
      "Liked him with dead and co man's litterally melted my face on several different occasions\n",
      "I had no opinion until you suggested GOAT, now I'm critical.\n",
      "This thread generally seems filled with beginner guitarists that think if you can‚Äôt shred you suck and have only heard Your Body is a Wonderland\n",
      "Most people hate John because of the media controversies from 2010. Most musicians hate him because they equate him with his early radio pop songs. \n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is he is a master blues player who got so tired of playing straight pop and blues that he took Jerry Garcia‚Äôs role in the Dead. Which is no small deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don‚Äôt know where he goes from here. His most recent album Sob Rock was a throwback to 80s radio pop, mostly because he got bored during Covid. Now Dead &amp; Company have had their final tour, at least with Bob Weir. It‚Äôs a big: what now?\n",
      "I feel those who hate him, hate him for 2 reasons. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. They hate the person he was. Or who he portrayed himself to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "They comment on the same handful of controversial headliners. Ie: Taylor Swift, his past dating profile. The Rolling Stones disastrous interview. \n",
      "\n",
      "People ignore how not everything is black and white, and how the media owns the information they publish. \n",
      "\n",
      "His comments from RS were horrible. But he did publicly explain and said he tried too hard to be funny (unsuccessfully) and hurt people he cared for in the process. He not only apologized, but he stepped back grew up and showed everyone how he is not the person he made himself out to be. He took accountability for his \"stupid mouth\". \n",
      "\n",
      "And 2. Those who think he is just \"meh\" technically, are those who are mostly familiar with his commercial success. They aren‚Äôt familiar with his music that is not played on the top 40 radio stations. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand how his music may not be everyone‚Äôs preference and that‚Äôs fine. But you can‚Äôt deny talent just because you don‚Äôt like something.\n",
      "He‚Äôs a great guitarist who plays not great music\n",
      "I like John Mayer but you comparing him to Hendrix is laughable. I think the hate comes from hearing people like you call him the GOAT whilst leaving out living contenders like Derek trucks who I bet John Mayer would agree is better at guitar.\n",
      "No meant as a knock to you, I just can‚Äôt stand his music or his singing voice\n",
      "Taylor Swift and her enormous catalog of breakup songs\n",
      "I don't hate him it just bores me and I don't connect with it\n",
      "He wrote the song ‚ÄúYour Body is a Wonderland‚Äù. That‚Äôs literally all it is. Otherwise really nothing to see other than a super talented musician.\n",
      "Lol folks have just been jealous of him since \"Your Body Is A Wonderland\".\n",
      "\n",
      "The women love him and he's a great guitar player. That's more than enough to draw the ire of the neckbeards. üòÑ ü§£\n",
      "He's keeping guitar very relevant in pop music, and has for two decades. Nothing wrong with JM in my book.\n",
      "He‚Äôs a great guitar player. But also a huge douche bag\n",
      "There are two sides to John Mayer. One side writes corny adult contemporary songs, which is what he is known for by the overwhelming majority of music listeners, and the likely reason he is disliked. The other side is an extremely competent guitar player that really is only known and appreciated by other guitar players and avid music fans.\n",
      "They hate him because he's commercially successful and hE dOeSnT pLaY tHe MuSiC i WaNt HiM tO so he's a \"bad musician\"\n",
      "He banged prime Jessica Simpson and like 20 other world-class hotties. Jealousy is a powerful force.\n",
      "His music doesn't resonate with me. But as a dead head his work with dead and co made me a big fan of his overall skill and passion for guitar.  That man can fucking play.\n",
      "I don‚Äôt hate him, he is talented, I just don‚Äôt listen to him because his music does nothing for me.\n",
      "I respect him as a dude because of songs like Slow Dancing in a Burning Room. Watch him play that live and you‚Äôll see his ability with restraint ‚Äî low compression and actually lowering his volume knob down to catch certain nuances. The guy is a performer and he‚Äôs a top notch professional. It‚Äôs hard not to notice once you get past the ‚Äúhe made a couple cheesy pop songs‚Äú phase\n",
      "Comparison is the thief of joy\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I love the people that influenced him alot but also i like him as a musician and songwriter for who he is. At least he is transparent.\n",
      "Do yourself a big favour and stop talking to these people. Or at least stop listening. \n",
      "\n",
      "Musicians that come out with stuff like ‚Äúgeneric ability‚Äù etc for artists like John Mayer, are just toxic. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are hardly any successful musicians who would be of that opinion. Why? Because talent respects talent. \n",
      "\n",
      "It may not be your favourite artist, or what you listen to in your car, but no one in their right mind would criticise a player, singer and writer like John Mayer. Any decent artist will recognise that he‚Äôs good at all three, and that a lot of his work is meant for mass consumption. Btw‚Ä¶ making music for mass consumption isn‚Äôt easy either. It‚Äôs perhaps the most difficult to create. Anyone who looks down on it is just bitter and jaded.\n",
      "His music sounds like what former boy-band members write when they eventually go solo. Not my thing but he's a good guitar player nevertheless.\n",
      "His guitar playing is beautiful but his songwriting is insipid. I learnt a lot of his parts from instrumentals (like Paul Davids playing Who Says) before listening to the actual songs and geez they are dull. Like Maroon 5 dull.\n",
      "Saw him open for Counting Crows a million years ago. Dude shredded. All the teenyboppers there to see him were annoyed by his 10 minute guitar solo where he talked through the different styles he was playing.\n",
      "\n",
      "l will forever defend John Mayer.\n",
      "He‚Äôs a great blues player. Honestly, other than that, overrated. Not a bad thing. He would probably agree and laugh at the people saying he‚Äôs the best.\n",
      "It irritates people that he's so good but he makes music they don't like.\n",
      "People don't like how he comes off like an Abercrombie model. It's a preppy kinda vibe. And his lyrics can be sensual and a little cringe. Doesn't change that he's a phenomenal guitar player who also can sit in on anything including one of my Fav Mac Miller songs of all time and he just found the pocket and the perfect notes to complete the song. He's good weather you like it or not üòú\n",
      "Jack can‚Äôt play or write like John. Jack hates John. Roll credits.\n",
      "He's good at what he does. I just don't enjoy listening to it.\n",
      "bro he was an asshole, ego-centric alcoholic..  \n",
      "he got sober and became the john mayer you know today..\n",
      "Personally I think he is a hell of a player. I have a hard time connecting with his music because it feels like he is not emotionally connected to what he is playing.\n",
      "People don‚Äôt like him because of his pop hits, but usually guitarists will still respect his guitar playing\n",
      "Personally I don‚Äôt find much he does very interesting. I think there are far less talented guitarists making far more interesting music.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I hear one of his songs I typically think ‚Äúwow that sounds pretty difficult‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt drive me to want to listen to his music past that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reminds me of Jacob Collier, extremely talented, just doesn‚Äôt make music I‚Äôd actually listen to. Or in my opinion, music that sounds like it has some passion and soul.\n",
      "Because a lot of guitarists are single minded and can‚Äôt accept that guitar is only a small part of the song. John is great but deliberately dials it back for the sake of the song. This is a concept that a lot of guitar players struggle with. \n",
      "\n",
      "He‚Äôs not the best guitarist ever in terms of range of skill, I‚Äôve never seen him do any metal style techniques or chicken pickin country licks, but he is a fantastic blues and jazz player and his songwriting is top notch. \n",
      "\n",
      "Being a great guitarist does not mean you have to do sweep arpeggios, but watch a guitarist try to convince a room of people how awesome Marty Friedman is when all they want to hear is a good song they can move to. \n",
      "\n",
      "I do think Mayer fans overhype him sometimes which causes some pushback, but a lot of the hate comes from John‚Äôs pop roots which is something guitarists need to just get over. No one is impressed that you hate pop.\n",
      "Mayer's definitely a good guitar player and what he does, he does with a lot of talent: playing the blues and blues-derived music. However, he is not the GOAT or some sort of guitar god like hardcore fans like to think. Once you step out of the blues, you can see that compared to legends like Eddie Van Halen, Randy Rhoads, Chris Poland, Marty Friedman, Alex Skolnick, Dimebag and many others, Mayer really isn't playing anything revolutionary or special and it's probably why people dislike him. He's being put on a pedestal when he doesn't have much to show for it apart from blues playing, which just doesn't really cut it anymore these days.\n",
      "He‚Äôs a professional musician and wants to make money like the rest of us. He‚Äôs got a pulse on what is happening and what people dig. I saw him on tour with Dead &amp; Co and was blown away. Amazing feel, tone, and improvisation.\n",
      "Whether you like him or not. You simply can't deny that he's one of the best guitar players out there. I mean his trio stuff is very impressive imo. For example everytime I watch his version of Ain't no sunshine I've to smile and I'm thinking, damn this is so good!\n",
      "John Mayer is one of the greatest guitarists of this generation. In addition he is one of the greatest pop song writers of this generation and he got so bored with it he plays with dead and company because he actually loves the blues and he crushes it on guitar.\n",
      "John mayer is a technical wiz who has been a gifted guitarist his whole life. There are so many subtle things he does while playing which the average player will have to think about. He has it as a natural part of his playing and can sing on top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, his inspirations draw from blues, funk, and pop. His pop music normally draws on themes and melodies from the former 2 styles.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, he has such a dynamic sound that never ceases to be expressive. Listen to Human Nature live for an example.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said i only know 5-6 songs and dont listen to him much. My old teacher loved him so I ended ip learning a few songs.\n",
      "I have no hate for John, he's a decent player, but I don't really have any particular love either.\n",
      "\n",
      "People keep telling me how amazing he is, then I listen to him and just remain completely unmoved.\n",
      "I thought he was a dork too for a long time.  My son started asking me if I could play this song or that and I realized he was a bad mf on guitars.  I watched a couple videos on youtube and he has incredible insights on playing music.  He seems genuinely nice and enthusiastic about giving the gift of music to others.\n",
      "It's bland, uninspired music that brings nothing new to the table.\n",
      "He‚Äôs a sleazy dude who writes terrible music\n",
      "I love JM and think of him as a big musical inspiration. I will say, many of his songs are bad. Bad bad bad. But the good ones are REALLY FUCKING GOOD and continum may be a perfect album.\n",
      "I think alot of people consider him \"overrated\" but honestly probably never really listened to him. He's definitely got some interesting playing.\n",
      "No hate here. I would love to play as well. It's hard to be a celebrity. He has done better at that with age.\n",
      "I am not going to comment on him as a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "His guitar abilities are absolutely beyond most.\n",
      "He plays Clapton better than Clapton.\n",
      "\n",
      "However he has created nothing that will be regarded as revolutionary as Clapton, Hendrix, SRV, Etc.\n",
      "I don't think people hate him, but many John Mayer fans are unbearable and think he is the greatest ever on guitar, sure he can play blues, but come on, he is not even close to the most technically skilled guitar player out there right now. It's like the video on YT where he play some basic stuff on a superstrat and the Mayer fanboys call it \"shredding\" and think it's some crazy shit, give me a break, it's not even close to something that Kiko Loureiro or some other shredder could do.\n",
      "The great lester bangs would have a field day with mayer who‚Äôs essentially this generation‚Äôs peter frampton, pop music‚Äôs interpretation of a guitar rock god.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its the same way, john legend is pop music‚Äôs version of an r&amp;b crooner. Or how taylor swift in her early career was pop music‚Äôs version of country star.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bland adult contemporary but under the guise of these different genres.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevermind his playing is pedestrian at best: doyle bramhall ii, art menenez, phil sayce can play rings around mayer. And yet to the unknowing ear, a record company can easily push some suburban blues pentatonic lines into gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, mayer‚Äôs songwriting is very derivative. From his early pantomime of dave Matthews to his sexless take on d‚Äôangelo, shamelessly hiring both ?uestlove and roy hargrove; to the politically limp waiting on the world, which is a blatant rip of curtis mayfield‚Äôs people get ready. His most recent albums are in that soulless mold of Sting‚Äôs current mood: vanilla bland ready for your auntie‚Äôs lexus apple playlist.\n",
      "\n",
      "and wow, his interviews are incredibly pretentious and cringey like that one overly confident college roommate we all knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "And didnt he have a vh1 show where most of his skits seemed to be at the expense of his own fans?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also much of what i understand about mayer has been due to all the weird stories i heard about him during his shortlived stint at berklee.\n",
      "I‚Äôm a metal head who‚Äôs into the caveman chugs , and I think John Mayer is awesome . He came here but tickets cost a kidney . Other than that , I think he‚Äôs rad and talented for sure . Some people don‚Äôt appreciate skill and the guitar community . There‚Äôs always a bigger fish .\n",
      "None of what you positively described about him had anything to do with the criticisms you‚Äôve heard. Idk much about Mayer, because I‚Äôm not a big fan, and I‚Äôm not because he plays guitar pop and it doesn‚Äôt really do it for me. It has nothing to do with how well he can be technically appreciated. I just don‚Äôt feel like his music says much. Pop music is just going to be hated, not because it‚Äôs unskilled - it takes skill to get there for sure. But it‚Äôs shoved down our throats ad nauseum in commercials and movies and tv and when art is forced into public dialogue that way, it‚Äôs gonna catch all the opinions of people who don‚Äôt actually want to listen to it.\n",
      "Others here have already covered the reasons many dislike Mayer in terms of his music, but I‚Äôll take a stab at another angle. \n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôve noticed basically since Continuum that Mayer seems to be a lot of new players‚Äô first guitar hero. Because of his accessibility, he‚Äôs the gateway drug - the first player to really blow lot of guys‚Äô minds with what can be done on a guitar. And that‚Äôs well and good in a way, but the problem is that a lot of guys hear Mayer before they hear SRV, Derek Trucks, BB King, etc. - if they ever continue digging to discover those guys at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "And therein lies the problem. I see so many guys who act like Mayer invented blues licks on a Strat neck pickup into a cranked 6L6 amp. They have no concept of the myriad of players who came before and influenced Mayer directly - from technique, to tone and gear, to style. They hear the solo on Covered In Rain and immediately and forever believe this is the greatest guitar player in the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hate to use this term unironically, but it all just feels so‚Ä¶ normie? Like Mayer is baby‚Äôs first pentatonic lick. And a lot of babies are so smitten with him, they never graduate beyond him out of the nursery and onto better things, and instead seem.. completely content to just gobble up even his most beige, bland, adult contemporary pop as though it‚Äôs the best thing they‚Äôve ever heard, despite that from a guitar standpoint, if we‚Äôre honest Mayer hasn‚Äôt played anything particularly inspired or exciting on a record since.. well, Continuum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I would at this time like to point out, that despite what I‚Äôve just said, I quite enjoy Mayer, from Room For Squares all the way to Sob Rock. But every time I hear a guitar player say their *favorite player* is John Mayer, I can‚Äôt help but internally roll my eyes a little.\n",
      "‚ÄúUp there with Hendrix‚Äù?? Not to shit on your hero, but not even close.\n",
      "For me your post sort of explains why I don‚Äôt like him\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a *very* good guitarist and a *very* good songwriter. But he is no where near Hendrix or SRV, and he is miles away from being ‚Äúthe GOAT‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "I disagree with that idea so much the more I hear people say it the more I dislike him \n",
      "\n",
      "Which to be fair isn‚Äôt his fault at all, he‚Äôs a case of someone who is clearly very talented being overrated by his hardcore fans\n",
      "I think he‚Äôs great, but much prefer his live work to his studio work. \n",
      "\n",
      "As many have already said, ‚ÄúWhere the Light is - Live in LA‚Äù is fantastic. Especially the Trio set in the middle. The acoustic stuff at the start is brilliant too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Intrigued about how his acoustic Solo tour will go &amp; have a ticket to go watch him in Dublin. Looking forward to it.\n",
      "John Mayer is easily one of the most talented guitar players of his generation.  I can understand not being a fan of his songwriting (although I disagree; songwriting is objective)  you cannot deny his ability.\n",
      "He's a very good, if rather sterile, player. But by god are his songs dreary. If it was just him twiddling rather than singing I think I'd like it a lot better, but I generally prefer my guitar with a hint of danger, and if there's one thing he's lacking it's that.\n",
      "I believe it‚Äôs because he a phenomenal guitar player but can also write amazing pop songs. For the simple minded, it‚Äôs very confusing.\n",
      "I was completely uninterested in him until he started playing with the dead. But the first Dead and Company show I saw blew my goddam mind. I had no idea he was such a good blues player.\n",
      "Great guitar player with supreme diarrhea of the mouth. I respect the man's abilities, but his decisions as a solo artist have always felt more egotistical than anything.\n",
      "It‚Äôs blues. It‚Äôs derivative and it‚Äôs nothing you haven‚Äôt heard before a million times over.  Yes, he‚Äôs a very good player! For sure. And arguably a very good songwriter who‚Äôs sold millions of records and won multiple Grammys, but necessarily because of his guitar playing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have no hate for the man, he‚Äôs a talented bloke that rips on guitar. \n",
      "But I snorted the coffee out of my nose when you said GOAT. üòÇ \n",
      "\n",
      "This isn‚Äôt golf, nobody‚Äôs winning tournaments and there isn‚Äôt a score or stats to quantify who the GOAT is.  It‚Äôs music and it‚Äôs subjective.\n",
      "I don't know shit about him as a person and I've never really studied his guitar playing technique. I just think his music sucks and isn't very interesting to listen to. It sounds like what you hear in a dentist office. He might be the greatest player on the planet or whatever but he is using that skill to make blase music for Kohl's commercials. I'd rather listen to a worse guitarist who makes better songs\n",
      "Seems like a good dude, obviously a very skilled player, makes Adult Contemporary music which isn't really my jam?\n",
      "\n",
      "/shrug\n",
      "\n",
      "Compare this to Yngwie Malmsteen who, to be diplomatic, loves him some Yngwie, who's stuff I find actively unpleasant to listen to.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think a lot of the backlash for Mayer comes from the (justified or not) fawning that some fans do over his ability. Which, if his music hits you with the impact of a light breeze - nice enough, but ignorable and won't move you - the praise can feel incongruous.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's my two cents anyway.\n",
      "While guitarists at large have accepted the level of talent he has, he was very much the pretty boy your girlfriend gushed for a decade ago. To many, he is basically a Justin Timberlake with a piss Fetish.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is a genuinely top tier guitarist, but that impression follows him.\n",
      "Although I can appreciate his technical skill and his ability to perform on stage I just don‚Äôt like his music.\n",
      "While a technically very impressive and talented player, I feel he brings absolutely zero innovation or anything new to the table musically. I LOVE blues, don't get me wrong, but that shit is approaching a hundred years old now and it's been done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus, he's always struck me as a huge douche from his interviews n whatnot.\n",
      "It's petty but someone in two polos with two popped collars playing Hendrix irks me\n",
      "He is a fantastic guitar player who creates unearthly tones, but I don‚Äòt care much for his songs or annoying voice :).  My favorite pickups right now are set of Klein Jazzy Cats inspired by Mr. JM So I owe him a great debt of gratitude.\n",
      "I love John Mayer. Unbelievable guitar player and a great songwriter too. He was a pretty crappy person in his younger years but he gives back a lot nowadays especially in helping out younger artists so I think that's cool.\n",
      "I saw Dead and Co in PA this year and his guitar playing was great. People unfortunately only know his sappy songs when he‚Äôs actually got some good stuff and is a great guitar player.\n",
      "People are mad that he's a gifted player, singer and writer who dared to look like a movie star.\n",
      "I have absolutely no idea. Never been a fan of his music, but his circular picking technique is so clean. He‚Äôs a technician and high-level player ‚Äî his songwriting and chord construction are underrated as hell. \n",
      "\n",
      "And he‚Äôs done a *great* job of copping off others (notably those rake sweeps from SRV and Robben Ford). \n",
      "\n",
      "I‚Äôd tap the brakes on calling him as seminal an influence as SRV or Hendrix though ‚Äî that‚Äôs premature and probably undeserved.\n",
      "Exactly he‚Äôs had some of the finest women he is talented so Fuck him.  lol\n",
      "Hate him? I seldom even think of him. He's got technique, but so do a lot of other people I don't listen to either. Technique on its own is empty. In his case, besides the technique, there's nothing to his music that resonates with me. Maybe he connects with other listeners, but I just don't get drawn in, past the level of \"hmm, that's interesting, how does he do that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And as for his personality and personal life, I don't care what he does as long as it's consensual and with adults.\n",
      "I don't like his solo shit, but as the \"fill in\" guitarist for the last iteration of the Grateful Dead after Jerry Garcia passed, I think he did a FANTASTIC job. He lived and breathed that music for 7 years and took it quite seriously.\n",
      "He‚Äôs a great player. Part of the hate might come from a string of controversies which ended with him saying the N word in the 2000s\n",
      "Cause he‚Äôs booooooooooring!\n",
      "As a metal and heavy music in general fan, I say it's just envy. He's a great player, period.\n",
      "He's a great guitar player and accomplished muscian.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't like his song writing style or his vocal affectation.\n",
      "\n",

He's a skilled guitarist for sure, but he hasn't really broken new ground or innovated in a meaningful way that I can see; unless you count late 80s leisure suit blues pastiche as innovative. It's like the epitome of music major songwriting; all the theoretical bones are well set, but the body they build around it is so plain and without blemish that it hits uncanny valley.\n",

Not that music is a competition or anything, but those two are legends, innovators and revolutionaries of their respected genres. I'm not saying John is bad, but there are thousands that do it better\n",
      "I think he's way more talented than what he actually puts out as records. He could very well blow our minds but I find the majority of his output to be quite unimaginative. I do really enjoy a subset of his songs but I'm always thinking he is capable of soooo much more. He is downright amazing at guitar and could take it far out if he wanted to imo.\n",

      "Lol if anyone tells me hes not, that just helps me weed out the ignorant folks or the edgy ones who dislike him just because.\n",
      "When people say he‚Äôs not a great guitarist I know I‚Äôm talking to an idiot and the conversation ends\n",
      "This is great, but I think some of his live performances of Belief are even better.\n",
      "I just laugh and walk off.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's a generational talent\n",
      "He just chose to make a lot of money with pop hits and I assume a lot of people can‚Äôt see beyond that if they say he‚Äôs not a great guitarist\n",
      "I don‚Äôt think this era of his playing is going to sway anyone that doesn‚Äôt appreciate him, it‚Äôs standard blues and nothing innovative at all, his playing has made huge leaps since¬†\n",
      "what‚Äôs this track ? sorry maybe a lame question but i‚Äôm not familiar with this one. john can play a little, i guess lol\n",
      "What performance is this from?\n",
      "Best version of this song ever. Crazy solo. Crazy tone.\n",
      "This is honestly my favorite guitar solo of his. The melodic section of it is so beautiful üò≠\n",
      "Many such cases\n",
      "What performance is this?\n",
      "Show them the Nick Jonas solo. That‚Äôs what they think how good John is.\n",
      "Come Back to Bed is very underrated IMO. Every time he played it live, he always has a different take to it, but JM always tries to play some of the conversational parts live, and they‚Äôre always amazing. Thank you for using this song as an example!\n",
      "Video is about a beat behind the audio. But yeah, he‚Äôs pretty good\n",
      "Whoever cut this video, cut out the best riff of the whole solo which is the final sequence.\n",

      "I thought, ok. Not exactly  a John Mayer fan, but why not. \n",
      "Then I saw him play the guitar and Holy shit, he could shred. I had NO idea. \n",
      "Gained a whole new respect for him when I saw/heard this.\n",
      "And this is an old video, his talent has only improved since then. His time with dead and company really influenced his style, his older material was more bluesy and these days he is more jazzy. I love how he embraced his new position in the band without being over the top and trying to take the lead. I‚Äôve been following him for over 20 years (went to college with his brother Ben), the past two years have been some of his best playing\n",
      "Hes done some of his best shit dancing around  come back to bed\n",
      "If anyone says John Mayer isn‚Äôt a great player‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt know ‚Äú shite from soap‚Äù\n",
      "[deleted]\n",
      "The criticism mostly comes from JM‚Äôs lack of bringing anything new to the table. He has taken in influences from great guitarists like Hendrix, SRV etc. and has mastered the elements that made them great.\n",
      "The only jealous guitar guys are the ones who got their girlfriends and moms dicked down by Mayer.  Just sayin.\n",
      "And here I see nothing to change that fact. Other than the jackoff faces.\n",
      "I looked but did not hear it\n",
      "Something about this video reeks of studio overdubs on guitar - no direct shots of his fingers, tone is really clean, etc. 100% agree with the premise that‚Äôs he‚Äôs phenomenal, but wouldn‚Äôt use this vid to prove it.\n",
      "Such garbage and out of tune\n",
      "His albums seemed to be very big during the 2000's and produced several hits. I know he is probably the poster boy for that White guy with an acoustic guitar that Todd seems to despise but what are your thoughts on him. I know he gets a bad rep for being to schmaltzy(Your Body Is a Wonderland being the most egregious offender). I personally just don't find his music all that interesting. I keep seeing him be praised as a guitarist but I just don't see it translate so much to his music. What are your thoughts on him?\n",
      "Great blues guitarist. Mid singer/songwriter.\n",
      "Any guitar player who's ever tried to play Neon will tell you that man is no mere mortal.\n",
      "He gave an interview with the New York Times awhile back and I felt personally called out by one of the comments:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I recognize the egocentrism of an introvert trying to make it in an extrovert's world. You can hear the self criticism, bordering on loathing at times, in most of these ramblings. He's so used to talking to himself that he forgets, when talking to others, that you can't say some of that, especially not the stuff that speaks to your prejudices\".\n",
      "Apparently he‚Äôs revived Dead &amp; Company with his guitar skills, so I won‚Äôt discount his talent.\n",
      "\n",
      "His first couple of albums were very meaningful to me in a teenage way. He seemed to catch that early 00s tension of growing up and not being sure if he was adult in a secure job market or a Peter Pan case forever. It was very millennial, singing about childhood nostalgia and frustration with being ‚Äústuck‚Äù in a transitional period of young adulthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think he‚Äôs ultimately just a pop idol from a different time. He didn‚Äôt update his mainstream music, and he always had a crass reputation, especially toward women, so that was always going to catch up with him. There was always an expiration date on his image, humor, and subject matter. I mean, his first big forays into the tabloids included cheating on Jessica Simpson and being photographed in a Borat swimsuit‚Äîso that‚Äôs a good idea of how ‚Äúof his time‚Äù he always was. Not much of a visionary or a trailblazer. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe check out Dead &amp; Company if you want to see his newer stuff? I‚Äôve never tried it but lots of my friends are into it.\n",
      "I think he comes across insanely arrogantly, but room for squares- continuum are phenomenal albums for me. Check out his John Mayer trio stuff for some solid white guy doing boomer blues licks\n",
      "I think he is to millennials, what Eric Clapton is to boomers. An objectively immensely talented guitarist and occasionally talented white guy blues rocker, who chooses to coast a lot of the time (and seems like an asshole IRL). \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "I don't think Mayer ever had a stretch as good a tenth as Clapton had in the late '60s/early '70s though. Idk if John Mayer had as good of a song as some of Clapton's late '80s/early '90s pop stuff even.\n",
      "I 100% get why people don't like him but I like Mayer.\n",
      "I have no strong feelings one way or the other \n",
      "\n",
      "There are both immeasurably more talented and interesting singer-songwriters and guitarists in general than John Mayer.\n",
      "IMO great musician but has said some gross sexist/racist comments in interviews (and allegedly in his personal life). Mixed feelings overall. He seems to be laying low these days, so hopefully his ego has mellowed out with age. Definitely one where I have to separate the art from the artist\n",
      "I think he needs to be seen in a New Light.\n",
      "I really liked his 2012 album Born &amp; Raised, which had more of an Americana/folk-y sound. \n",
      "\n",
      "The track \"Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967\" is supremely underrated. If you like dreamy fictional storytelling songs like Taylor Swift's \"The Last Great American Dynasty\", you'll love this song.\n",
      "As a guitarist, I can tell you he‚Äôs good. There aren‚Äôt as many guitar heroes from the 2000s and he‚Äôs one of them.\n",
      "He's an incredible guitar player. I haven't listened to a lot of his albums, but I did really enjoy his album Continuum. Love the blend of blues, soft-funk, R&amp;B, folk and pop on that album.\n",
      "\n",
      "He's the Peter Frampton of the 21st century. Great guitarist, okay songwriter, very popular with the ladies, considered a pretty boy popstar but begrudgingly respected by the guys due to his guitar chops.\n",
      "I don't care for his songs, but he's a hell of a guitarist.\n",
      "He‚Äôs capable of quality songwriting sometimes (The 1st 3 albums &amp; Born &amp; Raised), but Dead &amp; Company (even if they‚Äôre not my cup of tea per say) or band like it is the best use of his talents. He‚Äôs a shit hot guitar player that should be in a band, shut the fuck up and shred because his worst self sabotaging tendencies come out when he‚Äôs trying to be a pop star.\n",
      "John wrote a very personal, earnest album out of the box that got him worldwide fame. At a time when that wasn't cool.\n",
      "\n",
      " He was only 18/19 when he originally wrote most of those songs and when he finally \"popped\", I think he was unfairly criticized for some of those songs (Body). They were a bit sappy, but he was just a kid. 3 x 5 is on his debut album and it's a great piece of work. But that didn't become \"the hit\" of his album.\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways, all that critical feedback wounded him and he started to retreat and make his songs more opaque and vague. I think it really hurt his music as it felt like he was trying to be a modern day Springsteen or (worse) John Cougar. Meanwhile, he's out running around Hollywood bagging any hot actress of that time. A real disconnect with the person and his music.\n",
      "\n",
      "His run of albums of Continuum - Battle Studies show him feeling this out with mostly boring songs. Some hits though that keeps him alive in the public eye. \n",
      "\n",
      "He makes a wise decision of really leaning into blues guitar mastery around this time to earn some credibility. Which culminates in him releasing one of his best albums \"Born and Raised\" that kind of is the apex of John's early career. His song writing and guitar playing finally come together.\n",
      "Decently talented guitarist, incredibly boring songwriter and by all accounts an awful human being.\n",
      "Stopped trying for hits well over a decade, now gets to live his best life playing blues guitar and touring with Dead &amp; Co. Good for him.\n",
      "For me his songs vary wildly. I love songs like Clarity or Last Train Home (not the same as the lostprophets one).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But then Daughters happened and ugh what a slog.\n",
      "He was the opening act at a show at Saratoga Performing Arts Center in the mid 00's and OMG every single song... it sounded like he was EATING THE MICROPHONE.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than that - eh, he's an ok schmaltzy hipster schmaltz machine.  If you dig that kind of thing, he slays at it.  If you hate it, then yeah, he won't be your cup of tea.  He is to pop rock what Kenny G is to jazz.\n",
      "He sure needs a ton of fancy pedals and equipment for his borning ass clean tone\n",
      "I have literally never actually heard anything he's ever done (, to be fair I'm not in the US)\n",
      "He's not for me.\n",
      "Goat\n",
      "His first three albums are bordering on great, with some flaws. Continuum is probably his best sound, and I wish he had continued in that direction. \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead it seemed like he tried to go more pop, and not in the way he had started out either. I don‚Äôt like most of his stuff in between continuum and sob rock, and sob rock is alright, not great, but it seems like a bit of a return to form. \n",
      "\n",
      "He is a great guitarist who never quite lived up to his potential, and seems to have let his personal life get in the way of his career quite a bit. He is also well known to be an asshole, but like, so are a lot of famous musicians. Hell, Eric Clapton sounds like a complete dill hole, and he is still considered a GOAT guitarist.\n",
      "Immensely talented guitarist. Douchebag of a human. His public stock tanked hard after he broke up with Jessica Simpson and did that Playboy interview. I'm not gonna link it. You can go find it yourself if you‚Äôre curious. It's gross af.\n",
      "I really enjoy his first album.¬†\n",
      "That one Chappelle Show skit was pretty funny.\n",
      "Great guitarist, decent singer. Seems like a bit of a jerk according to his exes and that \"black girls don't like me cause I have a David Duke cock\" joke in a playboy interview in the early 2000's\n",
      "Great guitarist, terrible vocalist\n",
      "I worked in a restaurant is desperate need of a new sound system.  Every time ‚ÄúYour Body is a Wonderland‚Äù came on, which was often, I could only hear the bass beat and it made me crazy, and I wasn‚Äôt fond of the song to begin with.\n",
      "I like his SiriusXM channel. His playlists are very eclectic.\n",
      "Back to You always my fav song ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I always think that he have similar singing style of Michael Franks üôÇ\n",
      "His best song is a single called New Light from after his hit making days. I am pretty indifferent towards his more well-known stuff.\n",
      "I've only heard one song of his, but that song is the Heart of Life and it's beautiful.\n",
      "I get the Clapton comparisons to an extent because of the guitar skill, but the difference is that Clapton actually had songs that were not sappy crap like \"Layla\" and \"Cocaine\" just to name a few. Gritty songs that the whole world knows. Eric Clapton also had slow stuff \"Wonderful Tonight\", \"Tears In Heaven\" etc. John Mayer only has the sappy crap. Listen to any of his 2000s albums (2001-2010). So that's one stark difference between the two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, John Mayer appealed to the women because of his looks. Songs like \"Wonderland\", \"No Such Thing\" and \"Daughters\" are perfect examples of songs that were easy for Pop radio to play at the time. Nothing inoffensive. He was more of a Pop guitarist from the 2000s and was marketed that way. Coffee shop songs, you are correct that his talent did not translate into his music. \n",
      "\n",
      "John Mayer is just as well known for constantly being in the tabloids as he was for his music. Who was he dating? Over and over. The amount of hate the guy got I think people are forgetting. He was as loved as he was joked about. His legacy is that he is an exceptional guitarist who resorted to making sappy songs during his commercial peak, was good looking, and dated lots of famous women (who could blame him). I don't really mind his songs, but I would never go out of my way to listen to John Mayer.\n",
      "I think the problem with John Mayer was he thought he was charming enough to get away with his interviews...and he didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for his musicianship....its jarring that he went from pretty-boy singer-songwriter to Guitar God.  I mean, his guitar skills are great but it just came out of nowhere\n",
      "I really like musicians who are mid at their instruments but great at songwriting. Musicians who are great at their instrument but mid at songwriting bore me.\n",
      "His music is a snooze factory.\n",
      "I find all his other stuff pretty boring, but \"Stop This Train\" is the most heartbreaking song I can think of. It speaks directly to my own personal brand of melancholy and deepest fears¬†\n",
      "John Mayer is a decent pop songwriter but I think is not remembered fondly for 2 reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.) while he's a technically skilled guitarist, he lacks soul. His idol is Stevie Ray Vaughn, who was similarly famous for insane riffs without any personality.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.) while he wrote syrup-sweet love songs, he is known as kinda a skeeze to women (weird statements about his dick being a white supremacist, dating Taylor Swift when she was really young, etc). I think it's hard for women to imagine this man being so into you, when you know too much about how weird he is IRL.\n",
      "\n",
      "To your points about his music being schmaltzy, I think there's definitely some fatigue there, but there will always be a market for that - Mayer was kind of the Ed Sheeran of his day. We as a culture are just now tiring of Sheeran in the past couple of years, and I'm sure a new Mayer/Sheeran type is just waiting to be christened anew.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "(edited for spelling)\n",
      "I got into John Mayer a few years after they broke up. Got to know about their \"relationship\" from a swiftie who basically picked a fight with me over sharing a JM song on my Instagram story back when New Light came out (2018 I think) \n",
      "\n",
      "She told me how John is an asshole and he manipulated a teenager TS, How I shouldn't be consuming media of a serial manipulator and playboy and things like that. I obviously didn't know anything about it and I didn't find many credible details online either. I know they've gone back and forth writing songs about each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though I didn't have much info, I kinda stopped consuming John Mayer's music for a while because I thought he was an asshole. But the fact is, John dated Katy Perry after TS form 12-14 and hasn't been in any serious relationships ever since, keeps a low profile, and makes amazing music. While TS, well... I think you guys know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, I just wanted to know whether any of you know more about what happened between them.\n",
      "I‚Äôm a JM fan - and most of why I‚Äôm on this sub is because of the harassment of Taylor‚Äôs fans towards him and his fans, which she has largely encouraged. \n",
      "\n",
      "Most of what everyone believes happened is solely from HER point of view. There is absolutely nothing anyone she writes a victimizing song about can do to refute her story and this is why she largely ambushes people without telling them about it before it comes out because ‚Äúthe first lie wins.‚Äù\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, if you look at what can be proven: \n",
      "\n",
      "- He asked her to feature on a song when she was a young up and coming artist. He does a lot for up and coming artists, privately. Collaborates a lot with a ton of artists. \n",
      "\n",
      "- After doing so and during the promotion of the song, they went to dinner one time and performed the song at ONE event together. (I could be wrong here and that it was a one or two off but nothing like full on dating for months which is what he was accused of.) \n",
      "\n",
      "- She was seen at the filming of CMT‚Äôs Crossroads with her Mom. I can‚Äôt remember if it was his appearance with Brad Paisley or Keith Urban\n",
      "\n",
      "- She won a songwriter or best new songwriter of the year award and he was effusive in his praise for her during his introduction. \n",
      "\n",
      "- She released Speak Now and blindsided him. Honestly? My opinion - this is what can‚Äôt be proved - is he either inadvertently was too friendly or she misread signals and when he figured it out, he turned her down.  Based on her personality and what I‚Äôve seen overtime, I imagine she felt humiliated and embarrassed and turned on him.  I feel like she was potentially leaking that they were dating / a couple because her whole brand has ALWAYS been her attachment to famous men. He likely did ignore her at whatever awards show that one song was based on, likely out of just wanting to distance himself so she didn‚Äôt further infer a connection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on her comments since the initial release of Speak Now, which are really, really awful and alarming - even the comments about not caring how Jake was treated during the re-release of Red (I think on Seth Myers show?) he tried reaching out to her privately to understand. This reads like John - especially the comments about very long emails. I have no proof of that, just supposition that even her fans have made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since then he has had a comment or two towards her that shows it was very hurtful, but he keeps this incredibly limited.  \n",
      "\n",
      "People believe Paper Doll is about her. I don‚Äôt think it is - and he has given mixed impressions, likely based on what the current belief is by both fan bases. \n",
      "\n",
      "When Red was re-released, he got hit with a lot of death threats. The entire Swiftie fandom was nauseating, publicly waiting for his downfall and, publicly telling him he should kill himself - like what Scooter talks about in the documentary - that‚Äôs when he got the death threat in his DMs. I think the fan of hers that made the thread made it public with his reaction - and it got traction in the press and garnered sympathy for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "After that, once Speak Now was re-released, TS gave a milquetoast small comment not to harass people on her behalf before playing Dear John at one of her shows and said in her standard fare that she didn‚Äôt think about him anymore or that it was all behind her - I don‚Äôt have this exact language - but it‚Äôs her standard modus operandi. She‚Äôs done it with Kim Kardashian most recently where she wants to have the last word and then makes comments about it being in the past. With John that was after she basically bombed him with that Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve song. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me clarify that last part: I believe she added Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve to Midnights because she knew the PR on releasing it as a vault track on Speak Now TV would have created sympathy for him with further death threats likely.  Once that song came out, again her fans took her side and her meanings literally, but I always interpreted her ‚Äúmessed with‚Äù comments as in he ‚Äúmessed with her mind‚Äù which happens as a young women when you think an man you are enamored with is hitting on you but they‚Äôre just being kind.  I also interpret her ‚Äúgive me back my girlhood‚Äù as she had to grow up when he was telling her she wasn‚Äôt interested if it was truly written at the same time as Dear John or in retrospect with my impressions below. \n",
      "\n",
      "This has always perplexed me because her fans believe both JM and Jake were her first sexual experiences and they‚Äôre both equally hated for this specific thing.  And I‚Äôve never understood how that‚Äôs possible.  FWIW, the immediate aftermath is usually the most truthful - before she rewrites history with the first lie that gets repeated and reworked and I feel this was a Jake thing, but I could be wrong.  I think so many of her fans assume John was her first because of her intentional opaque comment that he ‚Äúmessed with her‚Äù and she wrote Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve waaay after the fact. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a JM fan, I hate that we have to learn so much of this to counteract her fans - and how aggressive and harmful they are in coming to our spaces to make accusations based on what she said. \n",
      "\n",
      "John is absolutely no saint. But what I appreciate about him is he learned so much from his mistakes. \n",
      "\n",
      "While he has never said so publicly (and wouldn‚Äôt dare do so) that was a semi-rough time for him on a personal level as his parents divorced around then - and as his dad is much older than his mom, from my perspective of having a parent that I‚Äôm a de facto caregiver for (my Dad since my Mom died and my half-sister doesn‚Äôt give a damn) when he had surgeries or medical emergencies, it pushes a sudden change on a family, in that capacity.  Additionally, no matter when parents divorce, it‚Äôs a shock to your foundation, as a person. His mother is an incredibly private person but his Dad has always been an incredibly supportive parent. While not an excuse it is very much an explanation that most people never hear - and I think that is also such a testament to John on an accountability level. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the more than a decade that has passed since a very bad timeframe for John, he has done so much and quietly. He founded Heart and Armor and didn‚Äôt do any press for it for 10 years. He has a Back to You foundation that privately helps kids and schools acquire instruments.  He regularly watches people learning the guitar and will give a quiet one comment of support to his fans without expecting it to be used for PR.  He helped his neighbors in MT when they had big floods by doing a solo show and then a solo show with Bob Weir. \n",
      "\n",
      "He‚Äôs really grown up, is a good egg, and the hate leveled against him at her hands is quite unfair.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He‚Äôs also a hell of a talented guitar player and writer. Where she has ghost writers, he has none and very rarely writes with other people on the albums he puts out in his own. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you haven‚Äôt checked him out recently and you are a former fan who loved 1989, please check out his last album, Sob Rock. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also has a phenomenal channel on Sirius XM - Life on Channel 14 that plays a wide range of music, not just his. \n",
      "\n",
      "And if you like what you hear, please join us at his sub r / johnmayer. We have a strict no mentioning of the Blonde One policy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Edited for clarity.\n",
      "nothing. i am convinced they were fake, they‚Äôve both said things to make me believe that\n",
      "Would‚Äôve, Could‚Äôve, Should‚Äôve on Midnights is also about John Mayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paper Doll by John Mayer is about Taylor Swift. \n",

      "Who knows? We only ever get one side and it sounds like both are angry with each other. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è \n",
      "I call it a case of her side, his side, and the truth. I will give credit to the females because there‚Äôs quite a few from Miley Cyrus to Vanessa Carlton who have made comments that speak to him being difficult.\n",
      "He was too old for her.\n",
      "She hints that jm was the first guy she was sexual with.\n",
      "john was becoming this hot sensational thing back in his young days which I think got to this head.  he has written a song ‚Äúmy stupid mouth‚Äù prior to all of his blunders which sums it up. after which he has practically owned up to his mistakes. moved away from hollywood. also had issues with his vocal cord and surgeries. he has immensely reflected, apologised and transformed himself. stayed low key. has become one of the finest songwriters and guitarist of his time. and dated katy perry who had played significant role in humbling him as well. however, their relationship couldnt work. if you listen to his albums TSFE and Sob rock you‚Äôll know katy was the one he truly fell in love with. I just recently found out after break katy wrote a song Unconditionally and released it on his birthday which I believe she wrote with John in mind. People do like to bring up jessica simpson‚Äôs book and other exes of John but he has cordial relationship with them except Taylor which brings me to the point where I believe what taylor wrote in Dear John accusing john of is actually not true. I remember reading a post here the other day about how taylor was asked about John and she was not actually answering the reality of things. beating around the bush. It could all be in her head considering how she can obsess over guys. John has admitted to all his wrongdoings except taylor‚Äôs accusation. As an avid follower of john‚Äôs music if anyone brings up his past I would like to call them out as hypocrite. cause if you believe people can grow up and change then believe that john has grown up and transformed for good away from all the lime light. if you keep dragging him to the mud and he is jot the problem. probably you are. thank you for coming to my ted talk. I hate swifties for this.\n",

He‚Äôs actually disgusting to me now! I‚Äôll never listen to anything from him again. He‚Äôs nothing but a playboy using women as another notch in the bedpost. A 32 year old man dating a 19 year old is actually disturbing. but, in the end, everyone knows he‚Äôs a creep because of her songs, no matter what he wrote, and he‚Äôll never recover from that.  I love that she fired back. Talk to the wall!!\n",

A dude wrote a song about a particular feeling he had dating a girl whose dad abandoned her (that‚Äôs what he said the song was about on Storytellers). But because it‚Äôs a hit and he‚Äôs John Mayer, the assumption is he is making a bigger universal statement on women and dating. I dunno. It‚Äôs a catchy song, he liked the cadence, and he had a specific scenario in his mind writing it. I‚Äôm not sure judging it in retrospect on its misogyny is relevant. Brown Sugar by the Stones is probably worse in that regard .\n",

People don't seem to question straight/gay female friendships quite as much as they do straight/gay male friendships.  It's quite obvious that Andy and John have a deep love and respect for one another, and I love that for them.

Of any style, that's still the style that interests a plurality of guitar players (as in not necessarily the majority, but at least more than any one other style). It might not be your cup of tea, and it's not mine either, but to this day most guitar players are still largely stuck in the 60s and 70s with some minor updates.

I remember watching a demo of the Digitech Supernatural, which is a whacky reverb, and you wouldn't believe the amount of comments of people asking if the pedal was capable of doing your average spring reverb. I also remember watching a demo of a Fuzz Face, and since I wasn't very familiar with the Hendrix tone, I couldn't understand why people were asking if it cleaned well when rolling the guitar's volume down. My point being: your average YouTuber will play what's expected from the reputation of the pedal: Big Muff? They'll play Pink Floyd and Smashing Pumpkins; Tube Screamer? SRV and John Mayer; Whammy? Tom Morello; Fuzz Factory? Muse or Jack White. Even Andy, \"from Pro Guitar Shop.com\" who is probably the best guy in the business for making us think we need to buy whatever pedal he demonstrates, kinda limits himself to what's expected from such effects. Sometimes people don't really know what to do with a particular pedal... I remember watching the Gearmandude demonstrating a Whammy pedal and saying loud and clear at the very beginning of the demo: \"I don't know what to do with this effect\" and then proceeded to fail miserably at making the pedal look good or desirable üòÇ\n",

      "In the same vein, Incubus's [\"Here in my Room\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IlPlKBXRHE) has the lyric \"Love is a verb\" in the chorus, yet every instance of the word Love is a noun and is only during that verse of the chorus. Also, technically he isn't talking about real love in this song, just sex.\n",
      "Try name any verb without it being a noun in your sentence. \n",
      "I told this to my dad and he said \"your mom killed herself because of you\" haha dads are so crazy\n",
      "Love is a battlefield.\n",
      "John Mayer is an incredible songwriter. A lot of the little things he puts in his songs make them really unique. For example, in the chorus of \"Your Body is a Wonderland\", he sings the hook three times and skips the fourth repetition that we expect to hear. The fourth line would complete the melody and feel like a natural ending for the chorus, but he excludes it to create a sense of \"longing\", which fits the theme of the song. It's really clever. \n",
      "In Pat Benatar's *Love is a Battlefield*, the word love is used 7 times, each time not as a battlefield.\n"
